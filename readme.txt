THEME SUPPORT:
If you have any questions or need the theme support please contact us via support@prashantc424.com.
Also you learn about our support policy.


IMPORTANT:
The frontend theme includes all the demo images/photos in the purchased theme folder just for your reference. 
For the demo purposes we used some images purchased from http://photodune.net/.
However if you like to use these photodune images(listed in "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders) then you will 
need to purchase a license for each used image. Metronic does not transfer any licenses for the images from photodune. Any image which is not listed in "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders can be used for free since they are open sources images.
